# Simple DS

Simple DS is a React component library generated from the SDS Figma UI kit.

## Goals

- Extract component structure, variants, and tokens from Figma MCP
- Build reusable React + TypeScript components
- Use CSS custom properties for theming via `--sds-*` tokens

## Planned Components

- Button
- Input
- Text
- Checkbox
- Switch

## AI Layout Rules

Cursor rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/` and are derived from the SDS Figma pages:

- `Composition guide` for responsive grid composition
- `Sections` for reusable section families and platform variants
- `Forms` for fieldset and form assembly patterns
- `Examples` for full-page recipe selection

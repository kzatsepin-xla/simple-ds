# SDS Page Recipes From Examples

Source Figma page: `Examples` (`7641:2142`).

- For full-page generation, start from the closest canonical example:
  - `Examples / Home Page`, `Examples/About`, `Examples/Contact Us`, `Examples/Pricing`,
    `Examples/Waitlist`, `Examples/Landing Page`, `Examples/Article`,
    `Examples/Shop`, `Examples/Product Detail Page`, `Examples/Portfolio`, `Examples/AI Chat`.
- Each example includes both `Platform=Desktop` and `Platform=Mobile`.
- Build implementation as a sequence of known section recipes (Header/Hero/Panel/CardGrid/Page/Footer),
  not as a monolithic custom page component.
- Keep platform parity:
  - Desktop and mobile should match section intent, order, and state behavior.
- Prefer composing from existing section and form recipes first; introduce new recipe only if no close example exists.
- Any new page recipe must be documented with:
  - chosen example anchor,
  - section sequence,
  - responsive mapping rules.

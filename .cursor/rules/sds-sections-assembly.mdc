# SDS Sections Assembly Rules

Source Figma page: `Sections` (`348:13000`).

- Build page blocks from section families, not ad-hoc wrappers:
  - Header (`348:13003`) and Footer (`348:13002`).
  - Hero Sections (`78:25151`).
  - Panel Sections (`373:12778`).
  - Card Grid Sections (`78:25153`).
  - Page Sections (`373:12938`).
- Every section recipe must support explicit platform variants:
  - `Platform=Desktop` (`1200` wide pattern).
  - `Platform=Mobile` (`375` wide pattern).
- For headers, include stateful variant handling:
  - `Platform=Mobile, State=Default` and `State=Open`.
- For hero/panel/card/page sections, preserve section intent from naming:
  - Examples: `Hero Basic`, `Hero Actions`, `Hero Form`, `Panel Image Content Reverse`, `Card Grid Pricing`, `Page Product Results`.
- Section-level composition must follow this order:
  1) choose section family,
  2) pick platform variant,
  3) place content primitives (text/cards/forms/media),
  4) apply tokens (`--sds-*`) and responsive collapse behavior.
- Do not create one-off section layouts when an existing section recipe exists in this page.
- When generating full pages, compose them from these section recipes before adding custom overrides.

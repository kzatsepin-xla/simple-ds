# SDS Zero-Assumption Gate

- Do not invent structure when SDS has a recipe in `Composition guide`, `Sections`, `Forms`, or `Examples`.
- Every generated page/block must declare exact Figma anchors:
  - `fileKey`,
  - page/canvas `nodeId`,
  - recipe/variant node names used.
- If `get_design_context` is unavailable, use only verifiable `metadata` facts and stop when critical facts are missing.
- Before finalizing, run a self-audit against `docs/qa/sds-page-audit-checklist.md`.
- A build is invalid if any checklist item is `FAIL`.
- If no matching recipe exists, create a new recipe doc in `docs/recipes/` first, then implement.
- For final deliverables, `knownGaps` in recipe files must be empty.

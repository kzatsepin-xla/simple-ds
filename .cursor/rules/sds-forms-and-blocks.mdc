# SDS Forms And Blocks Rules

Source Figma pages: `Forms` (`370:5433`) and `Composition guide` form patterns (`69:17183`).

- Reuse canonical form recipes before creating a new form:
  - `Form Shipping` (`197:23153`)
  - `Form Contact` (`197:19741`)
  - `Form Log In` (`197:19740`)
  - `Form Register` (`197:19742`)
  - `Form Forgot Password` (`197:19744`)
  - `Form Newsletter` (`197:19743`)
- Model forms as `Fieldset` + ordered rows, not flat input lists.
- Fieldset-level structure from composition patterns (`69:17183`):
  - Main fieldset width token `300`.
  - Mixed row archetypes: single field row, label+field row, checkbox row, actions row.
  - Inline split row pattern exists for newsletter (`204 + 80` inside width `300`).
- Preserve vertical flow:
  - Title/intro block,
  - input rows,
  - consent row (checkbox + text),
  - primary action row.
- Use existing components for form internals (`Input`, `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `Button`, `Text`) and never duplicate control primitives.
- Validation UI must be represented through component states (`default/error/disabled`) rather than custom one-off styles.
- All distances, typography, colors, and border radii must come from `var(--sds-*)`.
